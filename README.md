This package can be used to reconstruct materials from measured correlation
functions (as described in Salvatore Torquato's book "Random Heterogeneous
Materials" 
[ISBN 978-1-4757-6357-7](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387951676)) using
a procedure called "Simulated annealing".

Look at [this notebook](annealing.ipynb) for an example.
